--- Snippet from file: /LakesideMutual/policy-management-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties ---
```
# API keys should not be hardcoded in a real application but injected by the
# container or managed in a data store. We provide it here for convenience:
apikey.value=999ab497f8ec1052

spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:./policymanagement
spring.datasource.username = sa
spring.datasource.password = sa
spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver
```
Explanation: The `apikey.value` is hardcoded in the configuration file.  Also, the database credentials (username and password) are hardcoded as "sa". This is a significant security risk as it exposes sensitive information.

Suggested Refactoring:
* Move the API key to environment variables or a secure vault and inject it using `@Value("${apikey.value}")`.
* Similarly, store database credentials in environment variables or a secrets manager and inject them using `@Value`.  Avoid using default credentials like "sa".

# API keys should not be hardcoded in a real application but injected by the
# container or managed in a data store. We provide it here for convenience:
apikey.value=b318ad736c6c844b
```
Explanation: This snippet contains hardcoded ActiveMQ credentials (`queueuser`, `secret`) and an API key (`b318ad736c6c844b`). These should not be stored directly in the configuration file.

Suggested Refactoring:
* Move the ActiveMQ credentials and API key to environment variables or a secure vault. Inject them using `@Value("${spring.activemq.user}")`, `@Value("${spring.activemq.password}")`, and `@Value("${apikey.value}")`, respectively.

```
@Value("${apikey.validkeys}")
private String apiKeyValidKeys;
```
Explanation: While this code reads the API keys from a configuration, the way it's implemented suggests that multiple API keys are stored as a single string, likely delimited. This is not ideal for security and maintainability.

Suggested Refactoring:
* Store each API key as a separate entry in a secure vault or as individual environment variables.  Retrieve them individually in the application.  This allows for easier revocation and management of individual keys.

# API keys should not be hardcoded in a real application but injected by the

spring.datasource.url = jdbc:h2:file:./customermanagement
spring.datasource.username = sa
spring.datasource.password = sa
spring.datasource.driver-class-name = org.h2.Driver
```
Explanation: Similar to previous instances, the API key and database credentials are hardcoded.

Suggested Refactoring:
* Use environment variables or a secure vault for the API key and database credentials. Inject them using `@Value`.

{
  "activemq": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 61613,
    "username": "queueuser",
    "password": "secret",
    "queueName": "newpolicies"
  },
  "grpc": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 50051
  }
}
```
Explanation: The ActiveMQ username and password ("queueuser", "secret") are hardcoded in the configuration file.

Suggested Refactoring:
* Load these credentials from environment variables using `nconf.env()`.  For example:

```javascript
const nconf = require('nconf');

nconf.env();

const activeMQUsername = nconf.get('ACTIVEMQ_USERNAME');
const activeMQPassword = nconf.get('ACTIVEMQ_PASSWORD');

// ... rest of the code
```
Then, set these environment variables when running the application.
