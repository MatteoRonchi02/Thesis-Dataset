/LakesideMutual/risk-management-server/config.json
```json
{
  "grpc": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 50051
  }
}
```
Explanation: The gRPC service is configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) without any authentication mechanism. This allows any client on the network to connect and potentially send malicious requests.

Suggested Fix: Implement gRPC authentication. Options include:
* **Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  This is the recommended approach for securing gRPC. It ensures both the client and server authenticate each other using certificates.
* **Token-based authentication:** Use JWT or other tokens to authenticate clients.  Integrate this with an authentication service.

################################################################################
/LakesideMutual/risk-management-client/config.json
```json
{
  "gRPC": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 50051
  }
}
```
Explanation: This client configuration does not specify any authentication mechanism for connecting to the gRPC server.

Suggested Fix:  The client needs to authenticate to the server.  The method should match the server's authentication scheme (mTLS or token-based).  For example, if the server uses mTLS, the client needs to be configured with the appropriate client certificate and key. If the server uses token-based authentication, the client needs to obtain and provide a valid token with each request.

/LakesideMutual/policy-management-backend/src/main/java/com/lakesidemutual/policymanagement/interfaces/configuration/WebSecurityConfiguration.java
```java
/**
 * The WebSecurityConfiguration class configures the security policies used for the exposed HTTP resource API.
 * In this case, the API is accessible without authentication.
 */
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
```
Explanation: The comment explicitly states that the API is accessible without authentication. This makes all endpoints vulnerable.

Suggested Fix: Implement Spring Security to protect the endpoints.  At a minimum, require authentication for all requests.  Consider using OAuth 2.0 resource server functionality to validate JWTs issued by an authorization server.  Example:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorize -> authorize.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
        return http.build();
    }
}
```

/LakesideMutual/customer-management-backend/src/main/java/com/lakesidemutual/customermanagement/interfaces/configuration/WebSecurityConfiguration.java
```java
/**
 * The WebSecurityConfiguration class configures the security policies used for the exposed HTTP resource API.
 * In this case, the API is accessible without authentication.
 */
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
```
Explanation: Similar to the policy-management-backend, this configuration explicitly allows access without authentication.

Suggested Fix:  Implement Spring Security to protect endpoints. Require authentication for all requests and consider using OAuth 2.0 resource server functionality.  See the suggested fix for policy-management-backend above.

/LakesideMutual/customer-management-frontend/.env

PORT=3020
REACT_APP_CUSTOMER_SELF_SERVICE_BACKEND=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_CUSTOMER_MANAGEMENT_BACKEND=http://localhost:8100
REACT_APP_POLICY_MANAGEMENT_FRONTEND=http://localhost:3010

REACT_APP_CUSTOMER_MANAGEMENT_BACKEND=http://localhost:8100
```

Explanation: While these snippets themselves don't represent the vulnerability, they highlight the use of `http` instead of `https` for inter-service communication.  This is a security risk, especially if sensitive data is being transmitted.

Suggested Fix:  Use HTTPS for all communication between services, even within a supposedly trusted network. This ensures data confidentiality and integrity.  Obtain and configure SSL certificates for each service.

################################################################################
/LakesideMutual/spring-boot-admin/src/main/resources/application.properties
```
spring.application.name = spring-boot-admin

server.port = 9000
```
Explanation: The Spring Boot Admin application, which has access to sensitive information and control over other services, is not configured for security.

Suggested Fix: Secure the Spring Boot Admin application with authentication and authorization.  Spring Boot Admin provides built-in security features that should be enabled.  Consult the Spring Boot Admin documentation for details on how to secure the application.  This is critical to prevent unauthorized access to the monitoring and management interface.
