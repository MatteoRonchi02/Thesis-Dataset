/**
 * The WebSecurityConfiguration class configures the security policies used for the exposed HTTP resource API.
 * In this case, the API is accessible without authentication.
 */
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
```
Explanation: The comment explicitly states that the API is accessible without authentication.  The presence of `@EnableWebSecurity` and `@EnableMethodSecurity` without any further configuration suggests a misconfiguration, likely leading to all endpoints being accessible without any authentication checks.  This makes the service vulnerable to unauthorized access.
